# Flights_analysis

This analysis aims to find a pattern to forecast the price of a given seat in a flight based on different features like departure and arrival airport, flight duration, reservation of some plus, and others...
We use also the Principal Components Analysis to see the relations between the features and the boosting algorithms to improve our results.
